**About Me**

I am a fourth-year PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin co-advised by [Aryan Mokhtari](https://sites.utexas.edu/mokhtari/) and [Sanjay Shakkottai](https://sites.google.com/view/sanjay-shakkottai/home). I am interested in the theoretical foundations of multi-task learning, particularly in federated learning and few-shot learning contexts. Before UT, I did my undergraduate at Princeton University, where I worked with [Yuxin Chen](https://yuxinchen2020.github.io/).

## Recent News

- **May 2022:** Our paper [InfoNCE Loss Provably Learns Cluster-Preserving Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.07920.pdf) was accepted at COLT 2023.

- **October 2022:** I gave a [talk](https://sites.google.com/view/one-world-seminar-series-flow/archive/2022) on representation learning in federated learning at the Federated Learning One World (FLOW) Seminar.

- **Summer 2022:** I interned at Amazon Alexa under the supervision of [Jie Ding](https://jding.org/) and [Tanya Roosta](https://www.amazon.science/author/tanya-g-roosta). My project studied personalized federated learning with side information.
